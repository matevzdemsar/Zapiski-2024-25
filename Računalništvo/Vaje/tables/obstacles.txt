Obstacles: (d6)
1: A narrow and rickety hanging bridge. It is 60 ft. long. Walking across
it requires a successful Acrobatics check, the DC for which increases by 3
for every player currently on the bridge (13 for one person, 16 for 2 etc.).
A fall results in 2d6 bludgeoning damage. If there are more than 4 people on
the bridge at the same time, the rope holding the bridge snaps and everyone
must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, they manage to cling
on to one of the ropes and swing their way to the opposite side, allowing
them to climb up the rope onto the other side. A failure results in a fall.

2: A 30 ft. cliff face that takes a DC 13 Dexterity check to climb successfully.

3: A rushing river - not particularly deep, but 30 ft. wide and icy cold. There
are blocks of ice floating down that could serve as stepping stones (but it will
require a DC 13/15 Dexterity check). If a player falls into the river, they take 2d6 cold damage.

4: The way forward is blocked by a large boulder. The players must roll a combined
DC 65 Strength check to push it out of the way (Sycamore also helps).

5: A waterfall blocks the path. Getting wet means disadvantage on Constitution
saving throws against the cold. In the later stages of the climb, it also deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

6: A patch of flowers is growing all around the path. They seem to be on fire
(any potential snow around them has melted) but not particularly bothered by it.
Anyone who gets within 15 ft. must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d4
fire damage. The flowers are immune to fire and cold damage but die as soon as
they're pulled out of the ground.
